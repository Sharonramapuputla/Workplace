# QCTO Workplace Module: Predicting Banking Crises

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing economic indicators and predicting banking crises using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a structured workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

The project aims to identify key economic features that influence banking crises and develop models to predict their likelihood.


## Features
**- Data Preparation:**
- Handles missing values, standardizes data, and scales features.
- Includes outlier detection and duplicate removal techniques.

**- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Visualizes trends in inflation, exchange rates, and banking crises across countries.
- Includes heatmaps and animated choropleth maps for regional insights.

**- Machine Learning Models:**
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifiers.
- Model evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

**- Insights and Recommendations:**
- Summarizes findings, key insights, and future directions for economic policy or further analysis.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, plotly, and xgboost

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
basH
git clone https://github.com/Sharonramapuputla/QCTO-Banking-Crises.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
bash
cd QCTO-Banking-Crises

3. Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Launch the notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook QCTO_Workplace_Module_Notebook_Template_4571(1).ipynb

2. Follow the structured sections:

- Data Preparation: Run the preprocessing cells to clean and transform the dataset.
- EDA: Explore visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Train models and evaluate their performance.
  
3. Modify and extend the notebook as needed for custom datasets or additional analyses.

# Data Sources
The notebook utilizes publicly available economic datasets, including:

- Banking crisis events
- Annual inflation rates
- Exchange rates across countries
Ensure datasets are placed in the correct directory structure before running the notebook.
