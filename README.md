# QCTO Workplace Module: Predicting Banking Crises

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing economic indicators and predicting banking crises using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a structured workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

The project aims to identify key economic features that influence banking crises and develop models to predict their likelihood.


## Features
**- Data Preparation:**
- Handles missing values, standardizes data, and scales features.
- Includes outlier detection and duplicate removal techniques.

**- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Visualizes trends in inflation, exchange rates, and banking crises across countries.
- Includes heatmaps and animated choropleth maps for regional insights.

**- Machine Learning Models:**
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifiers.
- Model evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

**- Insights and Recommendations:**
- Summarizes findings, key insights, and future directions for economic policy or further analysis.
